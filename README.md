# Bug-Report-Writing-using-Bugzilla

A bug report is a detailed document submitted by a tester, developer, or user that describes an issue or defect found in a software application. The purpose of a bug report is to clearly explain the problem so that developers can reproduce it, understand it, and fix it efficiently and Bugzilla is an open-source bug tracking and issue management tool developed by Mozilla. It helps software teams track bugs, defects, enhancements, and other issues throughout the development lifecycle.
I identified different types of bugs with varying levels of severity and priority for a "Hotel Booking" website developed by my friend. These bugs were documented and reported using Bugzilla.
